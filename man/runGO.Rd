\title{Calculating pathway enrichment scores for scATAC-seq profiles}
\usage{
runGO(gmtFile, BGfile, countFile, method, globalaccessibility_scores,
  FGfile, promoters = FALSE, dist = 1e+06, threshold = 1.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{gmtFile}{pathway annotation/gene-set file}

\item{BGfile}{background file}

\item{countFile}{scATAC-seq count matrix}

\item{method}{If method is chosen as 1, data normalization is performed using global accessibility scores. If selected method is 2 then local accessibility score-based normalization is performed}

\item{globalaccessibility_scores}{global accessibility scores for input count data matrix}

\item{FGfile}{foreground file}

\item{promoters}{whether promoters to be used or not for conversion of scATAC-seq profiles to pathway scores. Default is false}

\item{dist}{distance to be used for considering nearest gene to a peak}

\item{threshold}{Peaks above the given threshold value are chosen to be in a foreground set}
}
\value{
A list containing two matrices, One matrix contains p-values based on hypergeometric test and other one is p-values based on binomial test
